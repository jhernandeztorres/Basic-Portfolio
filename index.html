        <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that
            or we walk! Oh yeah, good luck with that. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's
            time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
        <p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Do a flip! Who
            are those horrible orange men? <strong> Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.</strong>
            <em> $9.</em>95 a minute.</p>
        <p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is
            here. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I daresay that Fry has
            discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
        <p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Saving the world with meals on wheels. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!
            They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</p>
        <p>You hit me with a cricket bat. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. It's art!
            <strong> A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?</strong> <em>'!</em> I am the
            Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</p>
        <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always
            soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them
            unimportant. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>
